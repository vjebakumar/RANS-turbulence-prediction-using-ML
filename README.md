# Process simulation - RANS turbulence prediction using ML

The main aim is the verification and validation of a framework for acceleration and prediction of RANS turbulence models in an open source CFD solver using machine learning concepts. 
Different airfoil profiles are used in the framework for validation.


The framework used in this study is adapted from the work of following scientific papers:
1. Deploying deep learning in OpenFOAM with TensorFlow
2. A turbulent eddy-viscosity surrogate modeling framework for Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes simulations
## Installation
